Port of FPDF to C# and utility library

1. This is an automated port of FPF for PHP, mostly for fun purposes. Some parts have been recoded but many others are still as given.

2. This is not a full fledged tool, it is intendend to be used as last resource. If everything else fails or is too heavy and you have some time to spend, then, maybe this is for you.

3. Should you use it? Probably not. It's maintained just for fun. But if you like the DIY approach, then maybe it will suit you.
